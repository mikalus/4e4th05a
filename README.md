## Try it out directly
It is easy to program 4e4th into the TI MSP430 Launchpad.  
Download and install the free 430 version of the elprotronic programmer at  
 https://www.elprotronic.com/productdata;jsessionid=8FA5E1E626677AABC3683EC0D712B01F  
Select the correct processor 430G2553, point to the hex file you find here and follow the steps.  
Do not forget RESET after programming.

Then start your favourite Terminal program and start writing short examples, like in:  
https://wiki.forth-ev.de/doku.php/en:projects:a-start-with-forth:start0  
and there probably chapter 11c as a good starting point.
